# TensorFlow Experiments Phase 2

The Phase 1 of this project aims to provide simple and easy-to-read code for general TensorFlow usage (since very few online source could provide a clear overview for TensorFlow codes), which can be easily adapted to some TOY programs; however, the Phase 2 of the project will be more focused on the modularization and usage towards the real production.
